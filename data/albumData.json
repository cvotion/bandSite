That's why she was on the cover.' Talbot added lyrics after the music had been written by the rest of the band. He stated the songs on the album are 'to do with the roles of women in my life. It's also to do with the role my mum played pre and postmortem and also about progression and grief as a theme and eventual rebuilding'. The band recorded the album largely live in the studio, with each song recorded three times at most in order to keep a raw and urgent feel to them. It was produced by Space.",
